*Aplib: an Agent Programming Library*

Aplib is a Java library to program multi agent programs. As it is now, Aplib is still under development. 

Aplib follows the _Belief, Desire, and Intent_ (BDI) agent programming model. An agent is a stateful program. In the BDI term, the _state_ of an agent is called the agent's _belief_. When given a _goal_, the agent will desire to solve the goal. Without anything else, the agent will have no clue how to do this. Therefore, the programmer needs to provide it with a strategy. In a nutshell, a _strategy_ is a collection of guarded actions (g,A). The action A moves the agent to another state, and in doing so may produce a proposal to solve the goal. The guard g controls when the action can be fired. If the proposal solves the goal, the agent is done, otherwise a new guarded action is scheduled for the agent's next step. This is repeated until the goal is solved, or until the agent runs out of computing budget. If the strategy is as such that at any point there is only one action whose guard is enabled, all the intelligence to solve the goal was the product of the strategy. Such a strategy is nice if we have one, but we can expect that it is difficult to create such a strategy. It is more likely that we come up with a strategy that still leaves choices open. That is, there will be many points during the agent's execution where there are multiple actions whose guards are enabled. The simplest thing the agent can do is to just choose which one to execute randomly. This is in fact the behavior of aplib's SimpleAgent. In the future, we will add a module to let the programmer train the agent in making such a decision.


Aplib is inspired by 2APL (“a practical agent programming language”), but as the name says, aplib is a Java *library* rather than a dedicated programming language. Developing a library rather than a language was a deliberate design decision. We will instead the _embedded Domain Specific Language_ (EDSL) approach, where the main concepts of agent programming would be expressed as plain Java methods acting as _combinators_, as they are called in EDSL terms, and use tricks like _fluent APIs_ to mimic common anguage constructs. This allows us to just rely on the host language Java to check the syntactical correctness of agent programs written with aplib.
